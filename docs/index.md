### MakerCentral
Founded MakerCentral, a 3D-printing service marketplace that connects makers who want to have their models 3D-printed with experienced professionals that can 3D print it for them. Would have filled a niche many big players such as 3DHubs were ignoring, the nontechnical retail market that still wanted a degree of customizability, such as a middle school science class. Programmed the front-end and the back-end using JavaScript and Node.js technology, utilizing multiple APIs such as Stripe and Easypost.

First, the customer orders and the price is calculated| Then, they checkout through Stripe and instantly receive their tracking information
